Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I will be able to explain and demonstrate the following concepts without using Google:

General

Why Python programming is awesome
I can describe the features that make Python powerful and enjoyable to use—its readability, flexibility, rich standard library, and strong community support.

What an interactive test is
I understand how to run and verify code interactively (for example, using Python’s interactive shell or doctests) to confirm that functions behave as expected.

Why tests are important
I can explain how testing improves code reliability, prevents regressions, and helps maintain long-term project quality.

How to write Docstrings to create tests
I know how to embed examples inside a function’s docstring so that Python’s doctest module can automatically run those examples as tests.

How to write documentation for each module and function
I can create clear, concise docstrings that describe the purpose, parameters, return values, and examples for every module and function.

What the basic option flags to create tests are
I understand the key command-line flags for running tests (such as python -m doctest -v and common unittest flags) and what each one does.

How to find edge cases
I can identify unusual or extreme input conditions—such as empty inputs, invalid types, or boundary values—to ensure my code handles all scenarios.
